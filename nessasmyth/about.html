                <p>
                    I have had many brilliant opportunities to work with different athletes, across different
                    sports and see many parts of the world. I worked with Athletics Ireland for 12 years in
                    total and of that, 2006-2011 inclusive. I was physiotherapy manager. I continued to work
                    with individuaI athletes for 2012 right up until they left for London. I managed the physio
                    programme and was responsible for the physiotherapy management of the senior athletes at all
                    the major championships. I was very fortunate to have attended the

                        for the outdoors.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was there on the magical days when Ireland led the Medal Table after day 2 of the
                        European Indoor Championships in Madrid in 2005 when Allistair Cragg and David Gillick
                        won Gold, in 2006 when Derval O’ Rourke won gold at the World Indoors in Moscow and many
                        more.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was at many cross country championships with Fionnula Britton both as a junior athlete
                        and when she won her first Senior European Gold Cross Country Medal in Slovenia.

                    <p>
                        I also worked with Riverdance, touring the USA for 16 months, in 2003-2004. It was a
                        really interesting experience, working in the entertainment industry with professional
                        dancers and musicians. Essentially they are professional high performance athletes. We
                        performed 8 shows a week over 6 days for up to 22-23 weeks in a row….They have to look
                        after their bodies, address injury prevention, keep fit and maximise all the recovery
                        techniques…We moved as a company of 80 people every Monday to a new city, sometimes by
                        bus and other times by air. We even transported our own washing machines and tumble
                        dryers, as well as the very important coffee machine from city to city. I travelled with
                        Riverdance to China again in 2010. I worked with them again this summer2013 and gave a
                        talk to their new prospective dancers on Injury Prevention.

                    <h4>Winter Olympics</h4>

                    <p>
                        This year I had an opportunity to experience a new sport at a high performance level when I
                        travelled to the European Youth Olympic Winter games in Romania. Ireland had 4 youth downhill
                        skiers. I was very impressed by their skill and discipline at a very technical and tough event
                        in a challenging environment. It is hard work from carrying usually 2 sets of skis around at a
                        time, maintaining them in good working order, warming up in freezing conditions on the side of a
                        mountain and taking significant risks to edge fractions of seconds off their times.
                    </p>
                    <h4>GAA</h4>

                    <p>
                        In the earlier years of my career I worked with the Wicklow County Football Team for 3 seasons.
                        I also worked with the mens Leinster Hockey Team for 2 seasons.

                        I have participated competitively in many sports, athletics, swimming, badminton, tennis, hockey
                        and volleyball, at regional and national level over the years. I took athletics particularly
                        seriously, 800m in particular, competed over cross country as well as road races. This lead me
                        to triathlons in 2005 and onto an Ironman in 2007 as well as adventure races from 2008 and the
                        Long Distance Alpe D'Huez triathlon in 2010. I am also a keen skier, but very recreationally. My
                        dream to be a downhill skier is exactly that, a Dream...
