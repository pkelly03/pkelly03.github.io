<p>Learn how to make your baby fall asleep by himself</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘My bed is a nice place’ - need to know that their bed is a safe and secure place.</li>
  <li>Spend some time in the cot during the day playing with toys etc so that he gets to associate it as a nice place, if he responds positively to this try and get him playing with a toy as you fade away and watch him beside the cot</li>
  <li>Falling asleep in more than one way. Try to establish more. Currently sebastian falls asleep on mattress after bottle and then put him into cot. I have been putting him on the mattress but into the cot before he nods off so he is not as surprised when he wakes up, in fact the plan is that he find comfort waking there and should go back to sleep easier - and more importantly, on his own.</li>
  <li>Use a toy, not to take your place but to give some comfort in your absence</li>
  <li>Place him in between the two of you whenever you feed</li>
  <li>When baby wakes during night, do not talk to him other then the sleep cues, ie ssh and nighty night etc. do not turn lights on, affect his biological clock.</li>
  <li>Sleep cues, once you decide on them only use then when your baby is tired sleepy and relaxed. Do not use them when crying etc.</li>
  <li>You can use white noise as a sleep cue also.</li>
  <li>She noted, the way in which our baby falls asleep for the night is how he expects to remain all night long.</li>
  <li>Pulling hair to go to sleep, try Pantleys gentle removal plan. Let him grab your hair, but try to put teddy between you. But instead of letting him fall asleep pulling your hair, pull your head away. He will root for your hair, but try and use teddy, eventually he will want your hair again, repeat but take away again and replace with teddy. It might take 10 times initially. But should go down over time, and awakenings should lessen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Breastfeeding to sleep</p>

<ul>
  <li>Problem is that baby thinks it’s the only way to fall asleep.</li>
  <li>When you are sure your baby is awake and looking to nurse, go ahead and nurse him for a short time. Stay awake! And as soon as he slows his pace from the gulping, drinking mode to the slow fluttery comfort nursing, you can gently disengage him while patting him or rubbing him. (See Pantley’s Gentle Removal Plan above)</li>
  <li>If your baby whimpers at any point during this removal process, or somehow lets you know he is up for real (by crawling onto your chest, for example!), go ahead and breastfeed him. Then repeat the process to keep the nursing session short, and disconnect him before he is deeply asleep.</li>
</ul>
