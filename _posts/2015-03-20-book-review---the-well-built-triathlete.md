Chapter 5 - Functional strength 

Aim to provide a resistance program to target the following for your specific sport: 
   * Mobility 
   * Stability
   * Power
   * Strength 

Lots of programs fail because they don't target progression, repeating sessions week on week with progression is a waste of time, needs an increasing load to force adaptation. Never do the same program for 4-6 weeks without adding load

What adaptations are we looking for:
   * Neural recruitment is improved -brain talking to the muscles to get them firing
   * More muscular fibres are recruited increasing power and strength
   * Tolerance for anaerobic exercise improves 
   * Resistance to fatigue and overall efficiency

The first part of any strength program is developing good form and full range of motion through a movement. Then we can think about adding load. Always prioritise form over load. 

Break a year into phases

Phase 1 - foundational strength and stability 12-16 weeks in duration
Goal
  1. Increased mobility 
  2. Improved motor control and balance
  3. Strength progression in key exercises 

Phase 2 - Synchronisation and power do for 12-16 weeks


Strength focused exercises of phase 1 translate to more sport specific complex movements. This phase produces the largest amount of fatigue.
Goal
   * Further Improve mobility 
   * Increase stability through more complex movement patterns 
   * Improve muscle strength and power.

Phase 3 - race season performance 

Goal
   * Transfer movement patterns into sports specific movements and power
   * Maintain muscular strength
   * Improve muscular power and force potential


Nearly all the focus is on moving the load quickly and explosively. Strength session is still considered to be a key session during this part of the season. 

Be sensible on how you apply. On a rest day then it compromises recovery also if you do a tough strength session on a day with hard run intervals then injury might be likely
