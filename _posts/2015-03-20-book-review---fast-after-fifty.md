Science tells us there are three physiological predictors of your endurance performance that hold true across the aging spectrum: 

• Aerobic capacity 
• Lactate threshold 
• Economy

Aerobic capacity

Aerobic capacity is a measure of how much oxygen you use when exercising at a sustained, maximal workload. The more oxygen you use, the more energy you’re producing and the faster you can go. How fast you’re going when at your aerobic capacity is one of the best predictors of endurance performance. Also known as v02 max. The limiting factor is how much oxygen you can deliver to the working muscles and their capacity for using it. More simply put, VO 2 max is how much oxygen you are capable of processing per minute relative to your weight.

Moreover, as an athlete, your fitness age as represented by your VO 2 max is probably a better indicator of your body’s status than your chronological age. People with high aerobic capacities, and therefore lower fitness ages, are generally healthier and live longer. 7 When you find your “age” in this table, don’t be surprised to find that you are years younger than you thought!

Lactate threshold

What is it? your muscles use carbohydrate to create energy (specifically, they use glycogen— the muscle’s form of stored sugar), they create a byproduct inside the cells call lactic acid. As the intensity of your workout increases, this lactic acid begins to seep out of the muscle cell into the fluid in the surrounding space and into the bloodstream. As it seaps out however it's chemical composition changes and hydrogen ions are released. Lactate is useful for athletes, it's gets a bad rep unnecessarily, it's the hydrogen ions that are guilty of causing the burning sensation. Measuring lactate levels is really just for measuring how many ions are floating around interfering with muscle contract ions. At low intensities your body has no probs getting rid of the ions however passed you LT, they accumulate and laboured breathing etc kicks in. However you can become less sensitive to it by training at or just less than the Lt. Threshold. 

Economy

The less oxygen you use per minute at a given submaximal pace or power, the more economical you are. The more economical you are, the less energy (fat and glycogen) it takes to move your body.

What things can you control to improve your economy so that you use fewer milliliters of oxygen per minute? Perhaps the most common factor is technique. You can change how you move in order to waste less energy. You must realize that if you decide to go this route and make changes in your current technique, there will be a period during which you will become less efficient. This will show up as a higher- than- normal heart rate and somewhat more labored breathing at any given speed or power. And it may take weeks, if not months, to make the new technique your normal one. At that point, you should be faster at the same heart rates as before.
